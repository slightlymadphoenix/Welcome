Hi, these are the milestones for web development. The web development team is lead by a group of people similar to you with a bit more experience than you. Our goal is to transfer our knowledge and help you in all ways possible to introduce you and make you contribute to the world of Open Source and web development, for that you'll have to work with us constantly and consistently with dedication till a FOSS culture is set up in MEC.
